            prompt medical attention, is silently robbing millions of women and girls of their health,

    <div class='intro' id='intro'>
        <p>Obstetric fistula occurs when women endure prolonged, obstructed labor without access to emergency interventions such as cesarean section. These women end up with a seizure causing the leaking of urine or feces through the vagina</p>
        <p>It only happens in places where systems fail women and girls. Its existence is an indicator of extreme and systemic gender inequality. Globally, there are a vast number of women <strong>- approximately one million - </strong> awaiting treatment for fistula, and heartbreakingly, the pace of obstetric fistula continues to outrun the collective ability to meet the demand for treatment.</p>

        <p id='call2action'>But we can act and change this story.</p>
